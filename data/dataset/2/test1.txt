ing to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to
tea.’
‘Oh, that’s all right,’ he said carelessly. ‘I don’t want to put
you to any trouble.’
‘What day would suit you?’
‘What day would suit YOU?’ he corrected me quickly. ‘I
don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.’
‘How about the day after tomorrow?’ He considered for a
moment. Then, with reluctance:
‘I want to get the grass cut,’ he said.
We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line
where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept ex-
panse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.
‘There’s another little thing,’ he said uncertainly, and
hesitated.
‘Would you rather put it off for a few days?’ I asked.
‘Oh, it isn’t about that. At least——’ He fumbled with a
series of beginnings. ‘Why, I thought—why, look here, old
sport, you don’t make much money, do you?’
‘Not very much.’
This seemed to reassure him and he continued more
confidently.
‘I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see,
I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline,
you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very
much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?’
‘Trying to.’
‘Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much
of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.’
I realize now that under different circumstances that
conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.
But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a ser-
vice to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off
there.
‘I’ve got my hands full,’ I said. ‘I’m much obliged but I
couldn’t take on any more work.’
‘You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.’
Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the ‘gon-
negtion’ mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was
wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a con-
versation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he
went unwillingly home.
The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I
think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door.
So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Is-
land or for how many hours he ‘glanced into rooms’ while
his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the of-
fice next morning and invited her to come to tea.
‘Don’t bring Tom,’ I warned her.
‘What?’
‘Don’t bring Tom.’
‘Who is ‘Tom’?’ she asked innocently.
The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock
a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my
front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to
cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell
my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to
The Great Gatsby0
search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy
some cups and lemons and flowers.
The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a green-
house arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles
to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously,
and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-col-
ored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of
sleeplessness beneath his eyes.
‘Is everything all right?’ he asked immediately.
‘The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.’
‘What grass?’ he inquired blankly. ‘Oh, the grass in the
yard.’ He looked out the window at it, but judging from his
expression I don’t believe he saw a thing.
‘Looks very good,’ he remarked vaguely. ‘One of the
papers said they thought the rain would stop about four.
I think it was ‘The Journal.’ Have you got everything you
need in the shape of—of tea?’
I took him into the pantry where he looked a little re-
proachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve
lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.
‘Will they do?’ I asked.
‘Of course, of course! They’re fine!’ and he added hol-
lowly, ‘...old sport.’
The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist
through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby
looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s ‘Econom-
ics,’ starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen
floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to
time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were
1Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in
an uncertain voice that he was going home.
‘Why’s that?’
‘Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!’ He looked at his
watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time
elsewhere. ‘I can’t wait all day.’
‘Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.’
He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and si-
multaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into
my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself,
I went out into the yard.
Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was
coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped side-
ways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at
me with a bright ecstatic smile.
‘Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?’
The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in
the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and
down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A
damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her
cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took
it to help her from the car.
‘Are you in love with me,’ she said low in my ear. ‘Or why
did I have to come alone?’
‘That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur
to go far away and spend an hour.’
‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.’ Then in a grave murmur,
‘His name is Ferdie.’
‘Does the gasoline affect his nose?’
The Great Gatsby
‘I don’t think so,’ she said innocently. ‘Why?’
We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living
room was deserted.
‘Well, that’s funny!’ I exclaimed.
‘What’s funny?’
She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knock-
ing at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale
as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat
pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragi-
cally into my eyes.
With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me
into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and dis-
appeared into the living room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware
of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to
against the increasing rain.
For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the
living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a
laugh followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note.
‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.’
A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the
hall so I went into the room.
Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining
against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect
ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it
rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and
from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy
who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff
chair.
‘We’ve met before,’ muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive
attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to
tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he
turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back
in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of
the sofa and his chin in his hand.
‘I’m sorry about the clock,’ he said.
My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I
couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thou-
sand in my head.
‘It’s an old clock,’ I told them idiotically.
I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed
in pieces on the floor.
‘We haven’t met for many years,’ said Daisy, her voice as
matter-of-fact as it could ever be.
‘Five years next November.’
The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back
at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with
the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the
kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.
Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a cer-
tain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself
into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked consci-
entiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy
eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself I made an
excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.
‘Where are you going?’ demanded Gatsby in immediate
alarm.
‘I’ll be back.’
The Great Gatsby
‘I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.’
He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door
and whispered: ‘Oh, God!’ in a miserable way.
‘What’s the matter?’
‘This is a terrible mistake,’ he said, shaking his head from
side to side, ‘a terrible, terrible mistake.’
‘You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,’ and luckily I added:
‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.’
‘She’s embarrassed?’ he repeated incredulously.
‘Just as much as you are.’
‘Don’t talk so loud.’
‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently.
‘Not only that but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all
alone.’
He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with
unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously
went back into the other room.
I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he
had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be-
fore—and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed
leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was
pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s
gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehis-
toric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under
the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it,
like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer
had built it early in the ‘period’ craze, a decade before, and
there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes
on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took
the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into
an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the
black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasion-
ally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about
being peasantry.
After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer’s
automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material
for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoon-
ful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house,
appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large
central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I
went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the
murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and
the, with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that
silence had fallen within the house too.
I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitch-
en short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they
heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch
looking at each other as if some question had been asked
or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was
gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears and when I came
in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her hand-
kerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby
that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without
a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated
from him and filled the little room.
‘Oh, hello, old sport,’ he said, as if he hadn’t seen me
for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake
The Great Gatsby
hands.
‘It’s stopped raining.’
‘Has it?’ When he realized what I was talking about, that
there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled
like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light,
and repeated the news to Daisy. ‘What do you think of that?
It’s stopped raining.’
‘I’m glad, Jay.’ Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty,
told only of her unexpected joy.
‘I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,’ he said,
‘I’d like to show her around.’
‘You’re sure you want me to come?’
‘Absolutely, old sport.’
Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought
with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited
on the lawn.
‘My house looks well, doesn’t it?’ he demanded. ‘See how
the whole front of it catches the light.’
I agreed that it was splendid.
‘Yes.’ His eyes went over it, every arched door and square
tower. ‘It took me just three years to earn the money that
bought it.’
‘I thought you inherited your money.’
‘I did, old sport,’ he said automatically, ‘but I lost most of
it in the big panic—the panic of the war.’
I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I
asked him what business he was in he answered ‘That’s my
affair,’ before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate re-
ply.
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
‘Oh, I’ve been in several things,’ he corrected himself. ‘I
was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business.
But I’m not in either one now.’ He looked at me with more
attention. ‘Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I
proposed the other night?’
Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and
two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sun-
light.
‘That huge place THERE?’ she cried pointing.
‘Do you like it?’
‘I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.’
‘I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day.
People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.’
Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went
down the road and entered by the big postern. With en-
chanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the
feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the
sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn
and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-
the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find
no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no
sound but bird voices in the trees.
And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette
music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were
guests concealed behind every couch and table, under or-
ders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through.
As Gatsby closed the door of ‘the Merton College Library’
I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
ghostly laughter.
The Great Gatsby100
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed
absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred
to him that the colossal significance of that light had now
vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had
separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her,
almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the
moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count
of enchanted objects had diminished by one.
I began to walk about the room, examining various in-
definite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of
an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on
the wall over his desk.
‘Who’s this?’
‘That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.’
The name sounded faintly familiar.
‘He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.’
There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting cos-
tume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back
defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.
‘I adore it!’ exclaimed Daisy. ‘The pompadour! You never
told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.’
‘Look at this,’ said Gatsby quickly. ‘Here’s a lot of clip-
pings—about you.’
They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask
to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up
the receiver.
‘Yes.... Well, I can’t talk now.... I can’t talk now, old
sport.... I said a SMALL town.... He must know what a
small town is.... Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea
101Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
of a small town....’
He rang off.
‘Come here QUICK!’ cried Daisy at the window.
The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in
the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy
clouds above the sea.
‘Look at that,’ she whispered, and then after a moment:
‘I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it
and push you around.’
I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps
my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.
‘I know what we’ll do,’ said Gatsby, ‘we’ll have Klip-
springer play the piano.’
He went out of the room calling ‘Ewing!’ and returned
in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slight-
ly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty
blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a ‘sport shirt’
open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous
hue.
‘Did we interrupt your exercises?’ inquired Daisy polite-
ly.
‘I was asleep,’ cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of em-
barrassment. ‘That is, I’d BEEN asleep. Then I got up....’
‘Klipspringer plays the piano,’ said Gatsby, cutting him
off. ‘Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?’
‘I don’t play well. I don’t—I hardly play at all. I’m all out
of prac——‘
‘We’ll go downstairs,’ interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a
switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed
The Great Gatsby10
full of light.
In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp
beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling
match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the
room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor
bounced in from the hall.
When Klipspringer had played ‘The Love Nest’ he turned
around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in
the gloom.
‘I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play.
I’m all out of prac——‘
‘Don’t talk so much, old sport,’ commanded Gatsby.
‘Play!’
IN THE MORNING,
IN THE EVENING,
AIN’T WE GOT FUN——
Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow
of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on
in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were
plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the
hour of a profound human change, and excitement was gen-
erating on the air.
ONE THING’S SURE AND NOTHING’S SURER
THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET—
CHILDREN.
IN THE MEANTIME,
10Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
IN BETWEEN TIME——
As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of
bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though
a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his
present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been
moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short
of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of
the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her,
beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a
creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out
with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount
of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up
in his ghostly heart.
As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly.
His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low
in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I
think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish
warmth because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice
was a deathless song.
They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held
out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked
once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely,
possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and
down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there to-
gether.
The Great Gatsby10
Chapter 6
About this time an ambitious young reporter from New
York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked
him if he had anything to say.
‘Anything to say about what?’ inquired Gatsby politely.
‘Why,—any statement to give out.’
It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man
had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection
which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.
This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hur-
ried out ‘to see.’
It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was
right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who
had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on
his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short
of being news. Contemporary legends such as the ‘under-
ground pipe-line to Canada’ attached themselves to him,
and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a
house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was
moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just
why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James
Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.
James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.
He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific
moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when
10Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidi-
ous flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been
loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jer-
sey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby
who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE
and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break
him up in half an hour.
I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even
then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peo-
ple—his imagination had never really accepted them as
his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West
Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of
himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means
anything, means just that—and he must be about His
Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretri-
cious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that
a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to
this conception he was faithful to the end.
For over a year he had been beating his way along the
south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon
fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and
bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through
the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew
women early and since they spoiled him he became con-
temptuous of them, of young virgins because they were
ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about
things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took
for granted.
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most The Great Gatsby10
Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay par-
ties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself
he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.
And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy
of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He nev-
er understood the legal device that was used against him
but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.
He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the
vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substanti-
ality of a man.
He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down
here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about
his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover
he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached
the point of believing everything and nothing about him.
So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to
speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions
away.
It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.
For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the
phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with
Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—
but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon.
I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought
Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but
the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened be-
fore.
They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a
man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding
10Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
habit who had been there previously.
‘I’m delighted to see you,’ said Gatsby standing on his
porch. ‘I’m delighted that you dropped in.’
As though they cared!
‘Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.’ He walked
around the room quickly, ringing bells. ‘I’ll have something
to drink for you in just a minute.’
He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was
there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given
them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all
they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade?
No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks....
I’m sorry——
‘Did you have a nice ride?’
‘Very good roads around here.’
‘I suppose the automobiles——‘
‘Yeah.’
Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom
who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.
‘I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.’
‘Oh, yes,’ said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not re-
membering. ‘So we did. I remember very well.’
‘About two weeks ago.’
‘That’s right. You were with Nick here.’
‘I know your wife,’ continued Gatsby, almost aggressive-
ly.
‘That so?’
Tom turned to me.
‘You live near here, Nick?’
The Great Gatsby110
‘Next door.’
‘That so?’
Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation but lounged
back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing ei-
ther—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became
cordial.
‘We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,’ she
suggested. ‘What do you say?’
‘Certainly. I’d be delighted to have you.’
‘Be ver’ nice,’ said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. ‘Well—
think ought to be starting home.’
‘Please don’t hurry,’ Gatsby urged them. He had control
of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. ‘Why
don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if some other people dropped in from New York.’
‘You come to supper with ME,’ said the lady enthusiasti-
cally. ‘Both of you.’
This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.
‘Come along,’ he said—but to her only.
‘I mean it,’ she insisted. ‘I’d love to have you. Lots of
room.’
Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and
he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.
‘I’m afraid I won’t be able to,’ I said.
‘Well, you come,’ she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.
Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.
‘We won’t be late if we start now,’ she insisted aloud.
‘I haven’t got a horse,’ said Gatsby. ‘I used to ride in the
army but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in
111Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
my car. Excuse me for just a minute.’
The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and
the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.
‘My God, I believe the man’s coming,’ said Tom. ‘Doesn’t
he know she doesn’t want him?’
‘She says she does want him.’
‘She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul
there.’ He frowned. ‘I wonder where in the devil he met Dai-
sy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women
run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all
kinds of crazy fish.’
Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps
and mounted their horses.
‘Come on,’ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ‘we’re late. We’ve
got to go.’ And then to me: ‘Tell him we couldn’t wait, will
you?’
Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool
nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing
under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light
overcoat in hand came out the front door.
Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around
alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her
to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening
its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my
memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There
were the same people, or at least the same sort of people,
the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored,
many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the
air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before.
The Great Gatsby11
Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept
West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own stan-
dards and its own great figures, second to nothing because
it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking
at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening
to look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex-
pended your own powers of adjustment.
They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the
sparkling hundreds Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous
tricks in her throat.
‘These things excite me SO,’ she whispered. ‘If you want
to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me
know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my
name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green——‘
‘Look around,’ suggested Gatsby.
‘I’m looking around. I’m having a marvelous——‘
‘You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard
about.’
Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.
‘We don’t go around very much,’ he said. ‘In fact I was
just thinking I don’t know a soul here.’
‘Perhaps you know that lady.’ Gatsby indicated a gor-
geous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state
under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that
peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition
of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.
‘She’s lovely,’ said Daisy.
‘The man bending over her is her director.’
He took them ceremoniously from group to group:
The Great Gatsby11
He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive
crunched under his feet.
‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this
menagerie together.’
A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.
‘At least they’re more interesting than the people we
know,’ she said with an effort.
‘You didn’t look so interested.’
‘Well, I was.’
Tom laughed and turned to me.
‘Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to
put her under a cold shower?’
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhyth-
mic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it
had never had before and would never have again. When
the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in
a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a
little of her warm human magic upon the air.
‘Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,’ she said
suddenly. ‘That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force
their way in and he’s too polite to object.’
‘I’d like to know who he is and what he does,’ insisted
Tom. ‘And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.’
‘I can tell you right now,’ she answered. ‘He owned some
drug stores, a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.’
The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.
‘Good night, Nick,’ said Daisy.
Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps
where ‘Three o’Clock in the Morning,’ a neat, sad little waltz

of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the
very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic pos-
sibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there
in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What
would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps
some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinite-
ly rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant
young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one mo-
ment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years
of unwavering devotion.
I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he
was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable
swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the
black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest
rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the
tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his
eyes were bright and tired.
‘She didn’t like it,’ he said immediately.
‘Of course she did.’
‘She didn’t like it,’ he insisted. ‘She didn’t have a good
time.’
He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depres-
sion.
‘I feel far away from her,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to make her
understand.’
‘You mean about the dance?’
‘The dance?’ He dismissed all the dances he had given
with a snap of his fingers. ‘Old sport, the dance is unim-
portant.’
The Great Gatsby11
He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go
to Tom and say: ‘I never loved you.’ After she had obliter-
ated three years with that sentence they could decide upon
the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was
that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville
and be married from her house—just as if it were five years
ago.
‘And she doesn’t understand,’ he said. ‘She used to be
able to understand. We’d sit for hours——‘
He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate
path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flow-
ers.
‘I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured. ‘You can’t
repeat the past.’
‘Can’t repeat the past?’ he cried incredulously. ‘Why of
course you can!’
He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurk-
ing here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his
hand.
‘I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,’ he
said, nodding determinedly. ‘She’ll see.’
He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he
wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps,
that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused
and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a
certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find
out what that thing was....
... One autumn night, five years before, they had been
walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and
11Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
they came to a place where there were no trees and the side-
walk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and
turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that
mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes
of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming
out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among
the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the
blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted
to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he
climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of
life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.
His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came
up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and
forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath,
his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So
he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork
that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his
lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the in-
carnation was complete.
Through all he said, even through his appalling sen-
timentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive
rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard some-
where a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take
shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as
though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of
startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost
remembered was uncommunicable forever.

Chapter 7
It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest
that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday
night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Tri-
malchio was over.
Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles
which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a
minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were
sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a vil-
lainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.
‘Is Mr. Gatsby sick?’
‘Nope.’ After a pause he added ‘sir’ in a dilatory, grudg-
ing way.
‘I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell
him Mr. Carraway came over.’
‘Who?’ he demanded rudely.
‘Carraway.’
‘Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.’ Abruptly he slammed
the door.
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every
servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with
half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village
to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate sup-
plies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the
kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the
11Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com
village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.
Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.
‘Going away?’ I inquired.
‘No, old sport.’
‘I hear you fired all your servants.’
‘I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes
over quite often—in the afternoons.’
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house
at the disapproval in her eyes.
‘They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do some-
thing for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run
a small hotel.’
‘I see.’
He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to
lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there.
Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed re-
lieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And
yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion
for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that
Gatsby had outlined in the garden.
The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the
warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the
tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National
Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The
straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;
the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into
her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened
under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a
desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The publishing of a book is not the result of the work of one or two people, but a team effort. It is the end result of the work of many.

We thank those who took time to submit their praise reports of victories in the courtroom. May others be encouraged and strengthened through your victories.

Unless you have been involved in publishing a book, it is doubtful if you can comprehend the tremendous task of proofreading. Hour upon hour are spent reading manuscripts, one letter and one character at a time. Some people even proof back to front so they will not get caught up in the story and overlook a mistake. Just when a manuscript is thought to be perfect, another person can proof and discover new mistakes.

This process requires much time and a multitude of people. We send our deepest appreciation to the standers who have helped us to prepare _Your Father Knows Best_ for the printer.

Don W. Hardin, of Image House Designs, Coconut Creek, Florida has created many of our book covers. He is a dear Christian brother, who truly understands what the Lord has called our family to do. We thank God for the talent Don provides that makes our books look grand.

After every step of manuscript and cover preparation has been completed, funds are needed before printing. There are more expenses to this process that most people realize. We are especially grateful to people who contribute to Rejoice Marriage Ministries so that new books can be created.

May the Lord bless each and every individual who helped to make _Your Father Knows Best_ a reality.

ABOUT THE TITLE

If you are as old as I, you may recall a program starring Robert Young and Jane Wyatt from the days of black and white television. It was named "Father Knows Best." The fictional Anderson family, who lived in a town called Springfield, consisted of a mother, a father, and three children.

Every evening, Jim Anderson would come home from the office, take off his sports jacket, put on his comfortable sweater, and deal with the everyday problems of a growing family. Never in my wildest dream did I imagine that television programming could drift so far from "Father Knows Best" to the vile sitcoms that the world accepts as the standard today.

Never in my wildest dream did I imagine on our wedding day, that nineteen years and three children later, we would be divorced. Never in your wildest dream did you ever imagine on your wedding day that you would be where you are today.

Regardless of how much television programming has spiraled downhill, your Heavenly Father still knows best. Even as divorce appears to loom in your future, our Abba Father is calling for you to come to Him. He wants to be your Comforter, your Defender, your Protector, and your Savior.

"Will I be divorced?" We can't answer that, nor can any man, because that is in God's hands. It may take a divorce to bring your prodigal spouse to his/her senses. Charlyne and I can promise that nothing is going to happen to you today, tomorrow, or forever, that has not filtered through the Mighty Hands of God. He will not allow you to be tested beyond what you can endure.

Our prayer is that as you read through these testimonies from court, you will join us in praise and testimony to our God who is in charge. May you see in each one that your Father knows best, and He knows what is right for you.

Back in the days of watching "Father Knows Best" on a snow covered black and white screen about the size of notepaper, did I ever imagine where television would be today? Not the programming, but the technology. As I type this message to you, I am listening to the old hymn, "Safe In The Arms of Jesus," coming from the television in our family room. The music originated just seconds ago at a Christian radio station in Michigan, and was sent 23,500 miles to a satellite that bounced the signal back toward a small dish on our home.

Your dreams of living happily ever after have been shattered for now. But remember, your Father knows best. Instead of emotionally watching "Divorce Court" on the antiquated receiver of the world, look up and receive all the hope, comfort, love, and support that our Lord God has ready to send your way. You only need to tune into Him.

Your Father knows best. God is still in control.

A WORD ABOUT DIVORCE

We both understand what you are going through, because we were divorced in January 1986. Beforehand, we had gone through the property settlement agreements and child custody issues. We understand your feelings and emotions of what you are going through.

Charlyne filed for divorce, based on the "grounds" about which the pastors and counselors continued to remind her. No one shared with either of us that God can work miracles in hurting marriages, even in the courtroom.

Bob has often quoted Tony Evans, of The Urban Alternative, who once said, "It doesn't matter what the records down at city hall say. The records in Heaven still say that you are married."

Our Lord God may or may not stop your divorce. You need to remember that His ways are not our ways. If He had stopped our divorce, we would be limited in our ministry to you today.

Regardless of the Lord's timing in the restoration of your marriage, you cannot read the scriptures in this book without realizing that God is on your side. He is still in control.

INTRODUCTION

Monday night, at Rejoice Pompano Beach Bible Study, one of our ladies whose husband had filed for divorce requested prayer for her upcoming court date later in the week. In an effort to encourage her, Bob was sharing an incident that happened to another stander when she went to court. Charlyne added words of encouragement, relating about her own court experience.

We don't even know who said it, but someone added, "You should put all this in a book." Several others in the group agreed. At that moment, God birthed the idea for this book in our hearts.

During the past twelve years, we have heard more reports than we could ever recall about what happens when others are praying as a couple goes to court for divorce. We can all rejoice and acknowledge God's miracles in the sickroom, but do we always recognize His hand at work in the courtroom as well?

We have two purposes in compiling these reports from court for you. Foremost, is to give our Lord God the praise and glory for the victories, and to acknowledge that He is our Defender. In addition, we both want you to be encouraged as you read about the mighty God we serve.

May you be blessed by what your brothers and sisters from around the world are sharing. We'll see you in court!

Chapter 1

"LORD, ALL RIGHT, I HEAR YOU"

_"My soul will boast in the LORD; let the afflicted hear and rejoice. Glorify the LORD with me; let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears."_ _Psalm 34:2-4_

"I had filed for custody of our children when I discovered that my husband was with another woman. It all became rather tiring and burdensome.

"I cried out to the Lord and learned not to hold on to the bitterness and anger. I learned not to hold it all in, but to consecrate everything to God. He gave me _Exodus 14:14_ _'The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.'_ The other scripture I received from the Lord was in _Psalm 37:3-4,7_ _: Trust in the Lord and do good, dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart... Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him...'_

"I began bit by bit to let go of my darling spouse and to trust him in to the hands of our Father in Heaven. God is in control and He knows what he is doing. I have learned to totally forgive my husband and to love him unconditionally. It says in the Word in _1 Corinthians 13:5_ _'...Love keeps no record of wrongs.'_ I was to totally forgive my spouse and throw all the bitterness, jealousy, anger, rejection, and abandonment into the sea of forgetfulness and forgiveness.

"I received a letter from my lawyer stating that the court hearing for custody was a month away. A letter was to go to my husband's lawyer and we would eventually meet up in court. This was to be the first time I would see my husband in five months. I didn't know what I was going to do. I cried a lot through that week and gave it all to God.

"My husband's birthday was looming near and one morning the Holy Spirit told me to send my husband a birthday card. I dismissed it, thinking that I was running on emotions. Again, the thought dropped into my spirit, and again I dismissed it. It kept coming back to me until finally I said, 'All right, I hear You.'

"I went down to our Christian book shop and purchased a card and sent it. A couple of days later I received a phone call from my husband. He rang to thank me for the card. He sounded sad and very lonely. Weeks went by and I heard nothing.

"I'd had enough and rang my husband at work. I was so very tired of it all and just wanted to talk to him. My prayer partner was interceding for me while I was talking to my husband, and the next thing I knew, I was sharing my heart with him. I told him that I forgave him of everything that had happened, and I asked for forgiveness for not being there for him while he was going through hard times when we were together. I told him that I had tried to push him out of my heart and that I tried to hate him, but I couldn't. I told him I loved him.

"My husband came over for the first time in six months and we both hugged each other and cried for ages. He told me how sorry he was and how he loved our girls and me. He said that we had promised each other that we would grow old together. We talked for hours and shared heartfelt things with each other. We even talked about all the lawyers and the court hearing.

"We did go to court, but we went into it holding hands and sitting together. The judge wished us luck and hoped that things would turn out for our marriage and for our family. My lawyer spoke out in faith and said, 'This couple is looking like they will get back together.' Praise the Lord!" **(New Zealand)**

Chapter 2

"GIVE GOD TIME"

_"Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."_ _1 Peter 5:6-7_

A few years ago, the prodigal husband of one of our local standers was anxious for his divorce to be finalized so that he could marry someone else. On their court date, the wife had an opportunity to declare the permanence of marriage before the judge. He, in turn, asked her several pointed questions about marriage restoration, while across the aisle her husband fidgeted and fumed in his chair.

After all the testimony had been heard, the judge picked up his pen to sign the divorce decree, and then laid his pen down again. A few seconds later, the judge again picked up the pen, but could not sign the divorce decree. He laid down the pen for a final time, looked squarely at the wife and said, "I can't sign this today. We need to give your God time to work." A furious husband stomped out of the courtroom to go and tell the other person there would not be a second wedding anytime soon.

This standing wife did not know that the case had been assigned to a Christian judge. The judge and his wife had a burden for families and had hosted a weekly Bible study for teens in their home for several years. Not until eternity will we know what affect the testimony from that stander had on the judge.

Was this marriage saved? Sadly not. During the time the court was waiting on God to work on the heart of the husband, the stander's pastor could not be as patient. He introduced her to another man, whom she eventually went on to marry.

We share the ending to this story for two reasons. First to be totally honest with you. Second, to caution you that the enemy's greatest attacks often come just before or just after a spiritual victory. This stander was rejoicing so much in the court, acknowledging God at work that she left herself open for Satan's attack. **(Florida)**

"SO SCARED"

_"He will have no fear of bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord. His heart is secure, he will have no fear; in the end he will look in triumph on his foes."_ _Psalm 112:7-8_

"Several months after my husband left, he filed for divorce against me. There is no 'no fault' divorce in New York, so he had to have grounds to have the divorce granted. He was suing me for 'cruel and inhuman treatment.' I was going to fight the charges against me because they would have been false.

"Our court date was set in January. I had been praying every day that the Lord would intervene in this situation. I was so o scared when the day came, but I was covered in prayer and prayed and listened to praise music as I traveled to court by myself, just trusting that the Lord was in control.

"As it turned out, my husband never showed up for court and his attorney said he dropped all the charges! To God be the glory! Many things have happened since then, and I am still standing for the restoration of my marriage and my husband's salvation, but God is still on the throne! Praise Him for what He's doing that I can't see and all that He is going to do in my life and my husband's!" **(New York)**

Chapter 4

"THREE MONTHS"

_"You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly."_ _Psalm 75:2_

"My husband filed for divorce in May. I told him from the beginning I would never willingly give him a divorce. I have been standing for my marriage from the moment I found out about his infidelity. Nothing had been happening in our case, so the court set a hearing in October. Three weeks prior to that meeting, I filed a motion for mandatory counseling for my husband. It basically asked the court to set aside our case for three months to enable counseling for my husband. He was very angry about that motion.

"We all had to be in court, and I was told that I might need to explain to the judge why I thought counseling was needed. I was very nervous about that. On my drive to the courthouse, I prayed to God the whole time. I finally got myself to the place that I knew God was in control of this day and that He would be there with me and that I had no need to worry. The minute I walked out of the elevator I was completely at peace.

"As it turned out, there was no time to hear the motion, and we were asked to reschedule it. The judge then postponed the whole meeting. The next available date was January 30th. As I was driving back to work, I realized that even though my motion wasn't heard, the court still delayed our case for 3 months, which is exactly what that motion asked of the court. I don't know what that means but I do know that God knows! I continue to pray that God will use this time and work on my (Christian) husband's heart, and that my husband would seek God's will for his life." **(Florida)**

Chapter 5

"I KNOW YOU"

_"He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."_ _Joshua 4:24_

"I was in court for six hours and want to share the events with you. I have been fighting to save my marriage since shortly after my husband moved out. I must admit, at first I was glad to see him gone, but God worked a miracle in my heart to stand for the healing and restoration of our marriage.

"My husband filed for divorce. He left owing a lot of bills and wouldn't help pay for them. I was working part time, going to college part time and raising five children. I didn't have the money to go out and get an attorney to fight the divorce. I've had some paralegal experience, so I knew at least I could basically represent myself to file the response to his divorce action.

"I knew we were to have a hearing, but the paperwork was unspecific as to what was to be the subject matter. I found out when I got there, they wanted to have the full blown, 'get it over with' trial. Since we were going to try the case, we had to wait until everyone else on the docket was over with his or hers.

"My husband was on the stand until we broke for lunch. I told God I really needed some help. 'Provide those words for me Lord, like You promised me!' While I was at lunch, a friend that I'd phoned asked me what I thought about the judge. She had looked familiar to me all morning and I didn't know exactly why. I thought it might be from working at Kinko's, since a lot of attorney types came in there to copy their legal papers. Suddenly it struck me, right after he asked about the judge, why she looked familiar to me. She had been my attorney in another legal matter 22 years before!

"I had no option but to request a change of judge. When I got back from lunch, I told the bailiff that something important had come up concerning the case and I needed to talk with the judge. He told me it would have to be in the courtroom with the other attorney present and on the record. You should have heard the guffaw when I told them that the judge had once represented me. The judge's eyes bugged out six inches it seemed! My husband's attorney could hardly control herself. She was livid! The judge said she did not remember me.

"It took them another hour to have the original case, filed back in 1979, faxed to the court. The judge didn't want to give me my request, I could tell, since we'd already spent much time litigating that morning. I prayed that God would move her. I was prepared to accept that she would say no to my request. She, however, granted my request and I will have a new court date with a new judge. They want it to be in September, but there were no judges available at the time to make a definite date. They were all rather unhappy that they couldn't get an emergency hearing in another courtroom immediately. I felt that the judge and the attorney were both trying their best to get the divorce over and done with Tuesday, but GOD had other plans! He did provide me with the words to say in just the time I needed them!! I felt God's confidence at last and I was at peace.

"The judge declared a mistrial and we have to start over again with a new judge. I could tell the judge was literally having a struggle about letting me have my request for a new judge. It had to have been all those heavenly beings warring on behalf of my family and me. God has a plan and a purpose behind this whole mess. I had prayed that God would open my eyes like he did Elisha's servant to all the chariots of fire and heavenly hosts round about Elisha. He did this. His Word says that greater are those with us than those with them, and it's true!

"I am still amazed at God's providential hand and His clear answer to prayer on Tuesday, giving me the words to speak at the right time, that small voice that reminded me of where I knew the judge, and the angels that fought on my behalf as I saw the judge visibly struggle with declaring a mistrial and ordering the case sent to a new judge. Glory hallelujah! Worthy is Your name, O Lord.

"This year I have been praying and fasting for my husband and our marriage. The Lord gave me _Jeremiah 42:10 12_ to stand on: _'If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I am grieved over the disaster I have inflicted on you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.'_

"To me, this meant that I was to continue to stand for the healing and restoration of my marriage that I wasn't to fear the King of Babylon (the divorce itself), and that restoration is coming.

"You told me Lord, not to fear the King of Babylon, for You are with me, to save me and deliver me from his hand. You did that Tuesday Lord! I felt lowly and was getting whipped in court, but it was not in vain Lord. You exposed their strategy to me Lord, so I will be better prepared for the next wave of the assault from the King's army. You have strengthened my resolve; you have shod my feet and legs with iron so that I may keep on standing and standing and standing.

"I know my husband is not the enemy. He is being deceived and used by the enemy. God has changed my heart towards my husband and that is a miracle! I believe God is also trying to get my husband's attention, to draw my husband to Himself, to save my husband. I keep hearing that refrain play in my head 'God is in control.' He is!

"Since this time we've had other court dates and we went through two more judges. My husband now has his little piece of paper from the court that says what he wants, but it doesn't change the vow I made to my husband on our wedding day. I still see God moving in our marriage and lives.

"The kids and I are confident that one day Daddy will come to Jesus and come home to us. I don't know when that will be, but just as I know that the sun rises in the morning, I know that God will turn the hearts of this father to his children and our family will be restored." **(Missouri)**

"ANSWERING YOUR PRAYERS TODAY"

_"So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer."_ _Ezra 8:23_

"My husband had filed for divorce the day after leaving. He made it clear that there was no chance for reconciliation. His attorney called him one day to say that he was going forward with divorce proceedings since he had not heard anything in so long. My husband told him to 'hold off.' When he told me about this call, he also told me, 'Your prayers must be working!' Praise the Lord!

"A month later, the judge set a hearing date and said that we either had to go forward with divorce or drop it; that it had been in the system too long with no action being taken. On the very last Friday before we were supposed to be in court the following Tuesday, I got a letter in the mail from his attorney that everything had been canceled!

"I had been praying this whole time, and friends from church had also been praying. God had already given me a word of knowledge that called me by my first name and said 'He is answering your prayers today!' Because of that word, I felt like I had great faith, but on that Friday I admit that I sure was feeling down until I got that letter. God is so good. He always comes through just when we think there is no way!

"One other thing also happened that day that I believe was connected to our situation. The ladies from my church had gone to a women's retreat about 100 miles away. I didn't go because I really didn't have the money and needed to work. The evangelist who was there prophesied that 'some of you have been praying for something for a long time, and today is the day that God is going to turn it around.' Hallelujah!

"God is still working on us, and I have been so amazed at what He has already done. I almost can't describe it! I pray for prodigal spouses everywhere to be set free from the enemy's captivity today and come back to God and their families." **(Alabama)**

Chapter 7

"GOD THE COUNSELOR"

_"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever—the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you."_ _John 14:16-17_

"Several weeks after my wife told me she was going to file for a divorce, I received what I thought were the papers to indicate my approval or disapproval. I was to send them back with my position. I checked that I approved. It was strange; I didn't really realize what I had done until the next day. I had just given my 'okay' to divorce my wife. I cried out to God to help me and fix what I had just done.

"A few months prior to the court date, I spent some time in counsel with my pastor and prayer partner. They suggested that even though I was opposing the divorce, I should retain an attorney to make sure things are handled legally and so that I didn't make any mistakes. I retained an attorney and made my conviction very clear to him. He seemed to understand my stand, although I could tell deep down he thought I was nuts. I told him I had received the papers in the mail and had approved the divorce to go through. I showed them to him and he said what I had signed was that I had received the papers, not that I approved of the divorce!! God had answered my prayer. He cleared up everything.

"A week or so prior to the court date, my prayer partner asked if I would like him to go with me. God had given me a brother in Christ to lean on during this terrible ordeal. It gets better. The attorney had arranged to meet me at court at a specified time, but he never showed up. Initially, I wondered why. Then I felt the Lord telling me very distinctly, 'I am the only Counselor you need. You don't need someone else who doesn't seem to share your convictions fighting for you. I will carry you.'

"Throughout the entire hearing, he never showed up. I never heard from him again, and no attorney fee either! Before court began session we all waited in the lobby to be called in. During this time, my wife slouched down and broke into tears. The Lord gave me an overwhelming calm and peace and love towards her. So much so, that I was able to put my arm around her and console her while we waited. I whispered in her ear that all this didn't change anything in my heart about how I felt about her.

"We were finally called into court. While my wife and I were waiting to be called up by the judge, my prayer partner and I prayed intently. I realized after 10 or 15 minutes of seeking God's face, that I had a smile on my face! It was awesome. God's presence was absolutely awesome!

"When my wife and I were asked by the judge to approach the bench, she asked me where my counsel was. I told her that he didn't show up. But in my heart I knew the Holy Spirit was right there with me. My wife was in tears the entire time. I felt so much compassion for her that I wanted to reach out to her again and hold her. I was completely at peace it was amazing, terrible, but still amazing hard to describe.

"After my wife and her attorney stated their wants and reasons, the judge turned to me and said, 'So, I understand from the papers that you don't want this divorce. Why is that?' I answered with something like, 'Because, I made a vow to my wife and to God.' The judge asked if I was okay with the settlement amount. I said, 'Whatever she wants is fine.' She looked bewildered by my answer. She then asked, 'Is there anything else you would like to say before I rule?'

"I said with absolute resoluteness, 'I just pray that God will forgive each one of us here for what is taking place this day.' With that, she allowed the no fault divorce to go through. I do not wish that experience on anyone, but I am so thankful to God that He was my Counselor that day, and my refuge." **(Indiana)**

A BOBSERVATION

This man's message brought back memories of one of our legal encounters. I was to meet Charlyne in the parking lot at her attorney's office to pick up documents to sign. Yes, she is the one who filed for divorce, but I knew who was at fault.

That December morning, God allowed me to see my wife through different eyes. She had taken off from work for the attorney appointment. As she sat in her old Mercury Zephyr, I could see the tiredness and stress on her face. Working full time, going through a divorce, and being a mother to three kids was taking its toll on her health.

Had anyone given us any other option that day, the Steinkamp story might be different. Charlyne was doing what she had been told by man, not God, to do. Not until several months after the gavel had sounded did she realize the mistake she had made. Not until God touched me did I realize the mistakes I had made.

Charlyne and I know the toll that the legal wrangling can take on you. Nevertheless, may you view each contact with your spouse as another opportunity for God to touch that heart of stone.

"THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME"

_"You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."_ _Luke 12:40_

"A final hearing was scheduled for my husband's divorce. I had not yet been in court as I prayed against two other hearings and both times the attorneys had met with the law master and agreed on things.

"Just before I went to the courthouse, I prayed for God to do what he promised. I'm sure God has told me I am not going to be divorced. I said, 'God, I know what you told me, but there isn't much time. You're really going to have to work fast!' I went to the courthouse, and was handed papers with figures and articles of possession. My husband was taken to a room outside the main courtroom while I was left on the front row of the courtroom. The attorneys and the law master went to another room to discuss where things stood.

"I folded the papers I had been given, placed my Bible on top of them, and read and prayed for 45 minutes! I just kept 'reminding' God that there wasn't much time, but I knew what He had told me. When my attorney came out of that room, he told me my husband's attorney had very reluctantly asked for a continuance. They weren't happy with the figures.

"Now, my husband and his attorney think the 'figures' are the reason for the continuance. However, I believe even my attorney now knows the real reason. My son, who used to call me 'delusional,' is beginning to see who is in control. Praise the Lord!" **(West Virginia)**

"PRAYER DOES WORK"

_"For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."_ _1 Peter 3:12_

"My husband and I have been separated for 15 months, and he is running away from God. This man that used to attend church and pray, allowed the enemy to persuade him that prayer does not work. He was the defendant in a lawsuit dealing with his business. If he lost this case, it would be extremely detrimental to him financially.

"The attorney told him that he would not win the suit. I told my husband that our two sons and I were praying for him regarding the outcome of this case. The day of the court case, I offered to pray with him, which he refused, saying that he already knew the outcome and prayer would not help. Well, I told him that the boys and I were still praying and that the Lord is still in the miracle business.

"Later that day, my husband frantically tried to reach me and could not. He finally reached one of our sons and told him, 'Tell Mom I said thanks for the prayers because they worked and I won the case.' Praise God! My husband found favor with the judge and the fact that he won the case was a miracle from God. He also realized that prayer does work."

"THROUGH IT ALL"

_"Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future for the man of peace. But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off. The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble."_ _Psalm 37:37-39_

"My husband left our home about 16 months ago. He is a court bailiff at our local courthouse. He is friends with the judges. I medically retired from law enforcement a few years ago. We have several young children.

"When my husband filed for divorce, I told him that I don't agree with divorcing, but if he truly wanted a divorce I would go along with whatever he said. I told him that I would not fight him on anything because I loved him, but I would not be an active participant in divorce proceedings either. I would not sign the papers or show up in court for any reason. He would win by default.

"I was anxious about getting served the papers because I feared I might get served by someone on the department that was mean and might be involved with my husband's extracurricular activities. I was prayed up for the event. It was a female ex coworker of mine who served me. She was non-threatening, pregnant, and in plain clothes. I told her that I did not agree about divorce, and that the papers were going right into the trash. I told her that I was praying for my family to be reconciled. She said, 'I don't blame you one bit.'

"We politely chatted for a few minutes, and then I took the papers to the trash (That is where Satan's work belongs.). As more court papers followed, I read the information, and then pitched them in the trash. The papers expressed minimal child support, etc. I kept praying, 'Satan get behind me, you can't have my family.' I asked the Lord to be my protector. I never ever consulted an attorney.

"As the divorce finalized at default, all these horrible things on the court papers became legal bindings. I told my husband that I trusted that he would continue to take care of us as he always had. He had been threatening to sell the house. I am in no physical position to move because of major surgery. I felt extremely hurt and rejected, and experienced such despair and devastation. I prayed on and on and on. I have turned my husband over to the Lord, and I have been working on me.

"I have been able to witness to countless people about marriage reconciliation. All of my kids have chosen to be baptized through this trial, and serve the Lord in some capacity. I am blessed. My husband signed the house completely over to me, and has never taken the kids overnight to his place, or introduced or talked about the other woman. He continues to provide three times the amount that he had specified on the papers. He sometimes sneaks cash to me in my purse in between paydays. I continue to thank my husband and show him honor even though I am emotionally crushed.

"I continue to ask God for His provisions, and never ask my husband for anything. I believe my husband provides for me at God's prompting. I feel bad that my husband left everything, but feel extremely fortunate that the Lord has provided for my family so abundantly. We still struggle financially, but are blessed by God. I completely understand about legal matters. That was my profession. It is risky to do what I did by not seeking legal counsel, and is downright crazy according to worldly standards, but I have experienced first-hand about totally trusting in the Lord. I was afraid, but I followed God's way anyhow.

"I have been wavering in my stand this past week and was ready to give up today. Writing this helped me to remember how I am truly blessed. How quickly I forget. Thank You, Lord." **(California)**

"IN GOD WE TRUST"

_"For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory."_ _Deuteronomy 20:4_

"I had a court appearance in the summer, where the judge ruled that it was OK for my husband to divorce me after only being married for one year, and that she would not force him to stay married to me. She went so far as to say that she would grant the divorce if we had an argument about anything.

"I left the room, feeling distraught, overwhelmed and engulfed in my circumstance more than ever. As I was sitting there, praying to the Lord through my spirit, my attorney came to me and said that my husband was going to go for full custody of my child, and she wanted me to counter claim the divorce, which would allow for me to say all of the nasty things and divulge the circumstances of our separation to the court.

"I adamantly told her that I was standing on the Word of God, that He hates divorce, and no matter what happens, I would not deviate from what the Lord had given to me through His Word. She, being unsaved, didn't understand, but told me that she had to go before the judge who would now make a ruling on custody.

"As I sat there, I started praying and singing songs of praise to the Lord, knowing that He would see me through. My husband was sitting next to me, and I started speaking the Word over him. Suddenly, I looked up, and behind the judge's seat were the words 'In God We Trust.'

"I knew right then that I had my answer. As my attorney came out, she took me by the arm and said, 'The judge has decided. There will be no joint custody; there will be no forensics, no psychologist. You have sole custody of your daughter, with full jurisdiction over her well-being and religious upbringing.' I started shouting and praising the Lord, for I knew that if I had disobeyed and went the other way towards divorce, the victory would not have been mine. Praise be to God, who always causes us to have the victory through Christ Jesus." **(New York)**

"My wife and I signed divorce papers four months ago here in Canada. It was a simple process. We have the 'no fault' option after living apart for one year.

"The papers are supposedly on the way to the judge. Once he/she signs them, they become legally effective 31 days after that date. I am praying that the papers get either lost or destroyed in the system. Having worked in legal settings, it does happen." **(Montreal, Quebec)**

"MORE THAN ANYTHING"

_"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."_ _Matthew 6:14_

"My husband and I attended court and had to actually testify. We were in Illinois and he was required to prove grounds. My attorney knew that I was standing, and tried to accommodate me by not throwing mud, being vicious, antagonizing my husband, or making any decisions without my permission. Before going forward, my husband and I were sitting in chairs, mine behind his. The judge was putting on his robe up front, attorneys were assembling themselves at tables, and no one else was in the room. I leaned forward and kissed my husband on the back of the head, touched his hair and said 'I love you,' and walked shakily forward, not believing I was there. The judge saw all of this.

"While on the stand, my husband's attorney asked me, 'You don't want this divorce, do you?' I answered, 'Absolutely not, why would I? I love this man more than anything in the world.' Her final spear toss question was, 'How can you want to be with this man who abandoned you, left your marriage and your home, and moved 2000 miles away from you?' I answered in the softest, most loving voice ever spoken in court. I simply said, 'Men do things every day that women forgive them for; horrible things like affairs. My husband hasn't even come close to doing something like that and either way, I would forgive him for anything.'

"The judge said that he was not going to make any decisions that day. He was going to think about it for five days and would come back with his decision then. My attorney said this was unheard of. Usually they grant divorces on the spot. Five days later, the judge said, 'This is very unfortunate, I hate to be the one to do this, as this is a devoted Christian woman and this man is obviously not. What a shame, but unfortunately, divorce is granted.'

"Months later, when it was time to discuss financials, I refused to appear and argue about something so meaningless as money when our love and obedience to God were the real issues. So my attorney, not knowing what to do since the premise of court is two parties who disagree, requested I write a statement for him to read.

"It read like this, 'I am choosing not to appear today to argue with the man I love over something so meaningless as money. Only 11 months ago, my husband and I were renewing our vows in Jamaica. Now he has brought me here to a place where he swore we would never step foot as long as we lived. I am so emotionally devastated that the mere thought of being here makes me physically ill. I love this man more than anything in the world and the only thing I want is to build a life with him forever." **(Illinois)**

"OBEDIENCE IS THE KEY"

_'Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land."_ _Leviticus 25:18_

"We have been married for 30 years. We were high school sweethearts, so we have grown up together. I have been standing for my marriage for six years. There were many times my spouse said he was going to file papers and he never did. One night after work, at 9:00 P.M., I was served papers. Needless to say, I was shocked and hurt and desperate. I called my prayer partners and we intensified the prayers. I went to a Christian lawyer. It was imperative that I hear the Holy Spirit guide me in the words and way this petition was to be answered.

"I had 20 days to respond. I answered each question, and at the end wrote how I felt about marriage and the covenant that I shared with my husband and God, and that I was forever open to reconciliation and restoration, and that nothing is impossible with God.

"I really didn't want to see or talk with my husband during this time because the hurt and pain were just too much. I waited until I felt the Holy Spirit prompt me, and I mailed the reply and asked him to call me so that we could get together and discuss them, because I didn't want him to misunderstand anything I said. I told him my intentions were to defend myself against the courts and to never hurt him.

"My husband called and when he came, understandably I was a wreck. We sat at our dining room table and he thumbed through the papers. I got up time and again and went into the den to sob when all of a sudden the blessed Holy Spirit took over once again. My husband looked at me and said, 'Do you want to go to Ocala and see our son?' I said yes, and called our son and told him we were coming.

"He said, 'Huh? This sure has taken a turn Mom.' We ended up spending the day not only with our son, but we drove to Gainesville and got our daughter, and we all spent the day and evening together nothing but a parting of the Red Sea.

"As far as I knew in the natural, the papers were going through, but God gave me grace and mercy to carry on. There was a lot of interaction now between my husband and me, so when he called one night about something else but ended up telling me he was not filing papers you can imagine my joy. He said it was what I had written about marriage that turned his heart.

"We continue to interact, though he hasn't made any moves with words to come home. I just know the Lord has an appointed time and I pray with all of my heart it is soon.

"The one major thing God told me from the very beginning, when I had no clue where I was or where I was going, was obedience in the face of reason. I was to keep a short account with God, cleanse myself daily of anger, bitterness and resentment, and forgive even when I didn't feel like it. Willingness was, and is, always the key." **(Florida)**

"We had a preliminary court hearing. Many people had been asked to pray, as it was involving custody of my daughter and which of us would get to stay in our new home, built just a year ago. I was granted custody of our five year old. By agreement, my daughter and I had to be moved out of our house by Monday at 5 P.M. (Court was on Friday afternoon.)

"I was just going to put my things in storage and stay with a friend until we could find a place to live, as I was not working. My pastor was at the hearing and told me that our church owned a house and that the current resident was moving out that day! We were able to move into the church's house on Monday, with much help from many of our church congregation. The best part is we don't have to pay rent or utilities until I find a job." **(Illinois)**

"STILL IN THE FILING CABINET"

_"For in just a very little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay. But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him."_ _Hebrews 10:37-38_

"My husband of 24 years moved out, the day after I discovered them together, so he could openly be with the other woman. He told me that day that he wanted out of the marriage. In early January, he became adamant he wanted a divorce. One of us should file, he said. I asked if he were in a hurry and he said, 'No,' but the divorce should be filed by one of us. He made no move to file. Neither did I.

"I am living on a fixed income and am retired. In order to protect our finances and assets, I filed for divorce. There is no legal separation in Texas and no other way to ensure the abandoned spouse is not financially ruined by the prodigal spouse's bad spending habits. By filing for divorce and having an accompanying restraining order, the abandoned spouse cannot be held liable for bills incurred by the prodigal spouse and it also prohibits the sale of assets.

"Immediately after having filed for the divorce, which I do not want, my mother was notified that an x ray showed a spot on her lung. I told my husband of this and told him, if the spot was determined to be cancer, he could forget the divorce that he was demanding. I told him this was the one time that what he wanted was not top priority for me. My mother came first and I was not going to deal with him, a divorce, and my mother's cancer. He agreed that my mother came first, but stated he still wanted the divorce and saw no other reason for it not to be pushed through as soon as possible.

"The spot on my mother's lung was cancerous. Not only that, it was not one spot, but three. To top that, the spot was visible to me, an untrained person, on the x ray.

"In February, my husband and I signed restraining orders to accompany the pending divorce. While in the attorney's office to sign the papers, and have them explained to us, we were told to provide the attorney with a property settlement agreement and a debt distribution agreement. My husband asked extensive questions regarding these two matters while in the attorney's office. Both times we were in the attorney's office, the ladies in the office could not believe how well we worked with one another and how well we got along together and how courteous we were to one another.

"My mother had her surgery. A month later, in April, my father almost died from a hemorrhage in his lung. Since my father's surgery, there has been no moral support of any kind from my husband. He ceased to mow the yard for me in mid-May because the other woman did not like it. I also suspect that he could not handle the unconditional love and respect that I continued to show him each time I saw him! He has been to the house three times since then. Twice to make repairs to the house, because he told me he would continue to do the repairs here, and once to pick up some paperwork.

"I was notified by the attorney's office that we had a court date set for May 28th. It was to be our first and final court date. On that day, I would be a divorced woman. I called the attorney's office and just lost it. I explained all that was going on with my parents' health and said being the only child, I was on overload and had no help from anyone. I told them I could not deal with a divorce, the loss of my husband and the possible loss of both parents back to back.

"Believe it or not, I was told that it was understandable and that I should not have to deal with a divorce! I was told that the paperwork would be put in a folder and put in a filing cabinet! I was told not to worry about a thing! If at some point in time I wanted to proceed with the divorce, simply call and tell them! I asked how long the paperwork could be filed away like that without anything being done and was told anywhere from one to two years.

"During that conversation, I discovered that my husband had never provided the attorney with his portion of the property settlement agreement or the debt distribution settlement! I had not done mine either! I had not had time and did not want to do it.

"A week later, my husband called and wanted to know when the divorce would be final. I told him I had it stopped. He became very angry, yelled at me, and informed me that I could let the time run out on this paperwork that had been filed, but that he would get his divorce. He wanted out of the marriage. It was over! He was still adamant about getting the divorce. He would not be married to me.

"Here it is, the second week of November, and there has been no further mention of a divorce by him. He has not said the word 'divorce' to me since mid-May.

"I believe that my persistence in prayer, and the prayers of so many others for him have been a contributing factor to this. I also believe that it was divine intervention that all those medical professionals never noticed the cancer in my mother's lung for eight years. I believe that cancer became evident when it did for the sole purpose of buying me time to prevent the divorce from being final in May.

"I am still standing for this marriage. Still praying, and the divorce paperwork is still in the filing cabinet!" **(Texas)**

"GOD MOVES AROUND THE WORLD"

_"Jesus replied, 'What is impossible with men is possible with God."_ _Luke 18:27_

"In July, my husband who left the family two years previously, filed for divorce. Although my lawyer advised me that the hearing would be a formality and the outcome was a foregone conclusion, she said it was all right for me to write to the court regarding my reservations about provision for the children.

"I wrote regarding the fact that even if the court decreed the marriage dissolved on earth, I would still regard the marriage as an indissoluble permanent covenant relationship.

"The first hearing was in mid-August and the judge only got as far as the first issue before turning down my husband's application. She directed him to organize himself better to see our children more reliably.

"The matter was adjourned until September. All through the hearing I felt so carried and supported. It may seem terrible in some ways, but when I came out I felt quite bubbly with excitement at the way everything had gone and at the outcome. What had been intended for evil, God turned around and redeemed in His own way. God was so much there directing the proceedings. I hardly had to say a word, God did it all on my behalf. Praise God.

"I will be traveling to court next Wednesday, an hour's drive away after dropping the children at school. I am hoping that the divorce will be delayed again. No matter what happens, I believe God wants to, can, and will eventually restore our marriage. In the earthly realm it looks impossible, but God is a resurrection God and I believe in His time and in His way He will restore." **(New Zealand)**

"I was served with divorce papers the day after Christmas. The final hearing was in April. One week after the divorce, my husband decided that what he was doing was wrong and that he wanted to return to his family. He went to court and requested to withdraw the divorce, which was granted two days later.

"GOD IS MY PROVIDER"

_"For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them."_ _Isaiah 61:8_

"My court date was two years ago this last May. Even though it's been some time ago, I felt prompted to share how the Lord was present at the court proceedings.

"My husband was the one who filed for the divorce and he had hired an attorney. I felt I needed to hire my own attorney to give me legal counsel. I was so in shock and didn't know what I was supposed to do except stand in the gap and pray for the restoration of my marriage.

"When the court date drew near, my attorney called and advised me of how many thousands of dollars I could ask for in the settlement. After much prayer, I called my attorney back and advised him that I didn't want to ask for any money. I would only ask that my husband cover my attorney fees. My attorney thought I was absolutely crazy that I was not going to ask for any and all the monies that were due me. I told him I didn't want the divorce and that I believed God for reconciliation. My attorney asked, 'What does God have to do with this?' I told him that God was for marriage and not divorce. I must admit that this took a major step of faith on my part because I knew it would be very difficult financially for me, but I also knew that God was my Provider. Well, because I was going against my attorney's counsel he said that I would have to take the stand at the court hearing and testify why I was going against his counsel.

"The day of the hearing came and I took the stand. Before a few friends (who were praying), the attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and, most importantly, my husband, I was able to testify to God's ways. I was able to share that I did not want the divorce. I was able to share that man's way was divorce, but God's way was reconciliation. I was able to share that God was a God of covenant, and that marriage is a God ordained covenant.

"I was able to share that the Bible says, 'What God has joined together, let not man separate.' I was able to share that my desire was to be reconciled with my husband; not the monetary provision I could gain through the divorce. Lastly, I was able to testify that nothing was impossible with God.

"My friends that were there said that while I was testifying, the judge was looking at my husband with a look of amazement on her face like, 'Why are you doing this?' They said that the presence of the Lord filled the courtroom. In fact, after testifying, my attorney asked the judge not to grant the divorce in spite of Kansas being a 'no fault' divorce state. That was not planned; it was the Holy Spirit. My husband went through with the divorce, but the Word of the Lord went forth that day too.

I praise the Lord that He gave me the courage and words to speak for Him. Prayers for God to be glorified that day in the courtroom were indeed answered!" **(Kansas)**

"THE LORD WILL NOT LET THE WICKED SUCCEED"

_"He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness."_ _1 Samuel 2:9_

"May 23rd dawned bright and sunny, but a day full of doom for me. I was going to court, our first appearance. The shock of divorce had hit the previous October. I was lucky to have a friend by my side, and I also took my Bible with me. We seemed to be last on the docket for the morning, so I was able to hear cases being decided. I'd already begun the day with prayer and Bible reading, but I was still scared of what the judge might say, and of seeing my husband with his attorney. Our Lord proved faithful, as He always is if we but trust Him.

"I opened to the book of _Psalms, 36:4_ , and ended on the opposite page with _Psalm 37:33_. Verse _36:5_ is a song, _'Your Love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens. Your faithfulness stretches to the sky, Your righteousness is like a mighty mountain,_ (oh, yeah). _Your justice flows like the oceans tide.'_ Anyway, that was a comfort in itself, but the very last verse, **37:33,** says, _'But the Lord will not let the wicked succeed or let the godly be condemned when they are brought before the judge.'_ Wow! Talk about being specifically for me.

"A while later, the judge called us forward. My husband was about to blow his top with anger when she ordered him to pay more than he and his attorney had proposed, and to pay for half of my attorney's fee.

"God had provided my attorney miraculously. She had known me from when I'd worked at the health club a few years earlier. She had recently closed her family law practice to work full time for the District Attorney, but she took my case because she liked me. It turned out that the total cost for her services would be only $862! That was another miracle.

"THE END OF THE STORY"

_"I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth."_ _Job 19:25_

"I have been divorced from my beloved wife for over three years now, and I am standing strong. Her re-marriage is not affecting my covenant with her and with God, even though it is truly painful to face each and every day. But during my times in the courtroom, I felt the effect of everyone's prayers for my family, even though I feel that the results in the courtroom were very negative. I only see my youngest son every other weekend and do not see my oldest son at all, not to mention still being under the cloud of a bogus 'domestic violence' injunction. I also feel that my time in court was an opportunity for me to witness.

"The morning of the last hearing, when everything was supposed to be completed in court, I woke up with a message from God. He had me open my Bible to Matthew, Chapter 10.

"As the formalities in the courtroom were closing, I stood and read this to those in attendance. When I was done, I was sobbing as I headed for the courtroom door. The judge said, 'Mr. (name), I hope that you can recover from this and go on with your life' (interesting choice of words, huh?). I was not ungrateful for her sentiment, but she was missing the point. 'Thank you, your honor,' I said, 'but I believe God has had the last word in this case.'

"I have to wonder if any of them got it. God only knows. But God had something to say to those people, and he said it through me. I was torn up, but that day I really felt I was doing God's work.

"So now when my wife comes home and brings our boys back to me, everyone will see that for God's greater glory, things had to happen this way. And my family will be a fortress of strength against Satan. This is a story that I will relish sharing with the world until the day I go home to Him. With all the pain and horror that my life has become over the last few years, I would not have had it any other way because I know the end of the story." **(Florida)**

"I have been standing for three years. For about two of those years my husband has spoken of divorcing me. I told him to go ahead but that I couldn't sign the papers. He has known of my stand since the beginning. He finally submitted the papers in March. (He obviously dragged his feet on this, but praise the Lord!)

"I received the papers soon after, and the Lord told me to pray over them and put them away. I asked Him if I needed to get an attorney and the Lord said no. He is my Counselor. Months went by and nothing. He then had to submit yet another paper because I didn't respond to (sign) the originals. He again waited and did this in May.

"The morning of May 28th, in my quiet time with the Lord, He gave me _Psalm 46:5_ _'God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.'_

"That same day, in the afternoon, I got a letter in the mail that he filed the motion. I decided to do the same thing, just pray over the papers and trust the Lord. In receiving that verse, I knew that God was preparing me for something regarding the whole divorce thing. I had a great peace after reading those papers. I got more papers in the mail stating that his motion against me could not be filed.

"Looking back now, the Lord was true to His word; 'at the break of day' He helped me. He moved on the very next 'working day.' This scripture is confirmation that He doesn't want me and my husband divorced. I waited a month to ask my husband about this and he was clueless. He didn't even receive a letter in the mail from his attorney.

"Knowing that he didn't withdraw the divorce was even better because it accentuated the fact that God was behind this. To this day, my husband has not done anything further. In fact, he finally admitted to me recently that nothing in him wants to divorce me. Praise The Lord! My husband has moved into his own place. He is truly torn between me and the other woman, but God is moving." **(Florida)**

"DREAMS"

_"In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams."_ _Acts 2:17_

"I spent over a year standing and praying. Then suddenly, right after a court hearing (when we were due to be divorced that day), after a dream in which a man said God sent him to speak to me and told me I would not be divorced, after the judge postponed the hearing for two months later, miraculously and by the grace of God, after three years of separation, four children and I standing and agreeing in prayer, God was faithful and my husband came home.

"God is awesome, don't ever give up. When all seems hopeless, still praise God for restoring your marriage. Because it was when I wanted to give up that I walked by faith and not sight that he came home. Thank you Charlyne for your support and love." **(California)**

"I MISS YOU"

_"Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God."_ _Numbers 15:40_

"My husband filed for divorce in July. I left town and went to Georgia. My husband called me on Monday afternoon and told me that he missed me and loved me and had changed his mind about the divorce. I was very happy, but still felt a bit cautious in my spirit.

"Praise the Lord, on Thursday, our 20th wedding anniversary, I received in the mail the form from the courts stating that he had really dropped the divorce proceedings!!! God is in control and I know that at the perfect time, He is going to restore this marriage for His glory." **(Florida)**

"HEALED"

"O LORD my God, I called to you for help and you healed me." Psalm 30:2

"I had to do spiritual warfare for my marriage for over two years. It was not easy and I wanted to give up many times, but thank God, the Lord would not allow me to. God gave me strength when I had none, faith to believe His Word, and courage to endure the trial until He restored our marriage.

"It was God's Word, and much prayer, that kept me from divorcing my husband while we were separated. My husband also tried several times to divorce me, but again; the Lord intervened and would not allow him to divorce me either.

"One week before I was to start chemo treatment, God sent my husband back home. I had not even contacted him to tell him what was going on with me, because I did not know where he was. I had not seen or heard from my husband in over two years.

"God not only healed my marriage, but God has completely healed by body from cancer. I praise God for all that He has done and is yet doing in my life. My husband and I have a long way to go, but we are going in the same direction." **(California)**

"My husband and his girlfriend have ended their relationship. She called me and told me that my prayers have worked. Praise The Lord!

My husband and I are talking again. The divorce was supposed to be final on October 23rd, but wasn't, and he now has asked if we could wait and see what happens. He has also asked if we could start seeing each other more and he told me that he still loves me.

"My situation to everyone seemed hopeless, even to me most of the time, so I would like to remind everyone that our God is a good God and is faithful." **(Texas)**

"WHERE IS THE ATTORNEY?"

_"A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming."_ _Psalm 37:10-13_

"I am sure that the hand of the Lord has been on this process. I do not yet know the end of the story, however. My husband obtained his divorce in August. Equitable distribution was not settled at that time. The deposition stated that it was to happen within 90 days, but my husband did not bring forth the action. I do not believe in going to court.

"In August, the judge brought forth the action for equitable distribution on his own. Three days after I was notified of the judge's action, my husband's attorney died! The first court date was a 'no show' with a letter sent to the judge that a new attorney had been appointed and did not have enough time to prepare for that date.

"The day before the second court date, my attorney left a voice mail message stating that my husband's attorney had called to ask if I knew how to contact my husband. The firm had 'lost' the file and didn't know how to reach him. I returned the call to my attorney's office when I got home from work after the time of the court appearance. There was a 'no show' for a second time. My husband's attorney had called the clerk of courts to say which dates he was available.

"My attorney asked the judge to order mediation for the equitable distribution. The judge said that mediation could be done, but he did not order that it must be done.

"I contacted the Mediation Center when I received the court papers. I gave them the information I had as to how to contact my husband. I answered the questions about the case as well as I knew. I told them exactly where I am coming from and that I am standing for the healing and restoration of my marriage regardless of what my husband has done or said. My attorney has stated that the judge is unhappy that there has been a 'no show' twice now. It is also interesting that both my husband and I know this judge. We used to attend the same church. I brought this fact to the attention of my attorney who does not think it will be a problem. I am sure he has been placed over our case for a reason.

"I can see the Lord's hand in this matter, but the end result is yet to be seen. I continue to pray every day that the Lord take what Satan has intended for evil and use it for good; that the Lord use mediation or the court thing to bring my husband back to Him and then back to me; that His will be done in this matter." **(Virginia)**

"MARRIED TO AN ATTORNEY"

_"In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword. You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes."_ _Job 5:20-21_

"My husband is a lawyer who frequently does divorces. The first time he served me with divorce papers, I ran to the altar of my church and my pastor and wife prayed over them with me, that only God's will to be done, and by the power of the Holy Spirit we put them with the enemy under my feet!

"God filled me with peace, and a day or so later I called my husband and said, 'Do you really want me to sign these?' He said no. I had put the wedding ring he left behind with mine on the altar for God to restore our marriage.

"This has been almost a five year process. The second time he served me, a year or two later, church leaders and members kept praying. He left those papers with me after I signed them and never asked for them back, and I burned them.

"This last time, he very angrily served me and demanded that they be signed immediately, even though I was leaving the state. He was being greatly pressured. I kept praying against the spirit of fear.

"I kept praying about signing them, and felt I had to sign them but deny irreconcilable differences. He said he, 'wasn't sure' he would file them in court, but did immediately.

"I had to file an answer before my trip. My husband said his office would draw it up. His secretary said she had never seen him word it the way he did for us. 'I pray the court finds there are no irreconcilable differences and dismisses this action.' He started staying at home while I was away and moved home again. He had us both sign a dismissal and filed it in court and left a copy in _'her'_ door!

"God will build this home and family on the solid rock of Jesus Christ. Never, never, never give up on God, no matter how bad it looks, how bad it feels or how often it seems to go the wrong way. The battle is not ours but the Lord's. He has such an awesome victory in store for all of us. He will save my husband spiritually and physically." **(Maine)**

"TWO IN TWO WEEKS"

_"I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve."_ _Jeremiah 17:10_

"My wife moved out five months ago as a temporary separation, which then turned into her filing for divorce. I continued to stand on God's Word. I always showed her kindness regardless of how I felt or what I saw. I never acted on the circumstances as everybody was trying to convince me to do, get an attorney, move money to a different bank, etc.

"She came over Friday and gave me a kiss, which totally stunned me. Later, she called me and said she had wasps in her apartment. I went over there unannounced with some wasp spray to see if I could help. We talked and my wife said, 'I want to come home.' We talked and hugged and kissed. Our final divorce hearing was only two weeks away, and she said I would not need to worry about going that day.

"We serve a mighty God and I know that only He could have turned her heart. Only three weeks ago she told her father this divorce was what she wanted. She had told me, 'This is something I need to do.'

"The biggest miracle of all this is that my prayer partner was scheduled to go to his final divorce hearing and wanted me to fast and pray with him. Two days after my wife told me she wanted to come home, my prayer partner's wife went to the attorney and canceled their divorce.

"Two wives choosing to stop divorces and restore marriages in the same week! I was two weeks away from divorce, and my prayer partner was three days!

"Those of you who see no change in your circumstances, continue to stand on God's Word and trust Him. My wife had told me that she had been thinking about this for weeks, but I never saw a difference in her.

"Don't look at the circumstances. Trust the Lord. He is always faithful and right on time." **(Ohio)**

"I have not seen my husband in two years. He called and said he wanted to talk. He came over with divorce papers and asked me to sign them. I told him if that would make him happy, I would.

"He stayed and told me of his life. What horror he has been living. The other woman is hard to live with, complaining and nagging, and such. He is miserable, financially ruined, without friends, and has so many health problems. I just cried with all he told me. I said I would be here for him if he needed me.

"He left with the divorce papers in hand, unsigned. He said they had to be notarized. I have not heard from him in the past couple of weeks. Just to see him made me know I was honoring God by standing."

"My husband left home and filed for divorce a week later. I had a Christian attorney who supported my stand. We went to court and lost.

"The day after the decision was made, my attorney called and said he wanted to appeal the divorce. He would not charge me attorney's fees, but only the filing cost. When my husband found out, he was not mad. He said, 'Do what you think is right.'

"Tuesday we received notice that the divorce was overturned! We are still legally married! I have not heard from my husband yet." **(Mississippi)**

"CAN WE PRAY?"

_"You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more."_ _Psalm 10:17-18_

"My husband was a saint who has backslidden from his fellowship with the Lord. Last year, during our previous separation, he served me with divorce papers. I practically lost all dignity and begged him not to do it and expressed how I wanted our marriage to work. He decided not to go through with the proceedings.

"Now here we are a year later and he again has told me that he is divorcing me and wanted to know if I will sign the papers this time. I told him, 'No problem, I will sign them this time,' and I truly mean that. About a month ago he told me he was sending me divorce papers. I haven't seen them yet.

"After nine months of not seeing the children, he came by this past Sunday to see them. I gave him a bite to eat and I went upstairs to give him his space to see the children because he came to see them and not me.

"When I heard him telling the children good bye, I came downstairs to walk him to the door. He started a pretty lengthy conversation so I asked him if he wanted to sit down and talk. He agreed. On his way to the door I asked him if he wanted to have prayer. He agreed. The kids and I all gathered together and prayed. He did not pray, but he joined hands with us to pray. I felt like that was all that God wanted to do that night, for me to pray for him. I could see on his face that he was touched.

"My words of encouragement to all those in legal proceedings are this:

**1.** Trust in the Lord and meditate on His Word.

**2.** Get out of the way and let God get in the way.

**3.** Work on yourself and leave your spouse to God.

**4.** Pray and focus on your spouse being saved and filled with the Holy Ghost before mainly focusing on them coming back home.

**5.** Get a life; invest some time in yourself and your children. Take some classes, attend some extra church services, and go on dates with your children.

**6.** Learn how to get in touch with the truth of God's Word rather than your feelings.

**7.** Make part of your daily prayer include 'Not my will, but thy will be done.'

"My prayer is always, 'Lord, not my will, but, thy will be done.' I don't know where my marriage stands today or what the outcome of it will be, but I do know that the Lord holds my future and I will be all right." **(Pennsylvania)**

_"Confuse the wicked, O LORD, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city."_ _Psalm 55:9_

"God is awesome. I just want to thank Him that even though at times, when you give up, He hasn't. I have been separated for one year. I seldom had any contact with my husband.

"Recently, I got a telephone call from my husband saying he wants a divorce. I was so fed up with the whole situation, thinking God has promised me something and nothing seem to be happening, that I told my husband go ahead with whatever he wanted and I will abide. Things suddenly started to change drastically.

"My husband came and spoke to me; he has not gone to the court to organize for any divorce. My husband had vowed never to venture from our home again. He came home and spoke to me without hesitation. He seems so confused. I could literally see where there is a fight within him. I truly want to thank God. God is still working." **(Trinidad)**

"I WANT TO HEAR FROM GOD"

_"But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."_ _Matthew 17:21_

"I met a new friend. She learned that I had initiated divorce proceedings and said that she would put my name and my husband's name on the intercessory altar at her church and cover them with the Blood of Jesus. She then bombarded me with books, tapes and phone calls. I said that she would have to pray that I heard from God. One morning, as I was in the middle of teaching, I had this inner insistence to phone my solicitor. It was not possible to get through, so in the end I drove home so he could phone me back. He phoned me back five minutes before I was due to return to teach. 'It's amazing you should phone today. The petition is ready to go.'

"'Well stop it,' I said. The friend would not leave me in peace until I instructed my solicitor to tear up the divorce papers. She had to wait until I heard from God myself on that one too. Then, about six months later, I had a letter from my husband's solicitors. I didn't know what to do. When I told my solicitor that God had told me to fast the following week he said, 'In that case, we don't have to do anything.' And we never did. That was quite a few years ago." **(United Kingdom)**

I have been praying, along with fasting, for three years that God would send him home with me and our children. It has been three weeks now and he has not even mentioned the words attorney or divorce. He has been coming around more and calling since he made his decision to divorce me.

"I've been turning up the heat on the devil in prayer and fasting like never before. I constantly pray the scriptures over my husband and our situation. _Proverbs 16:9_ says, _'A man's heart deviseth his way, but the LORD directeth his steps."_ **(Georgia)**

UNFAIR

_"But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed."_ _1 Peter 4:13_

"Last Easter, I attended a divorce hearing which went against me. Despite abundant prayer, the judge ruled against me and came down in favor of my prodigal spouse. My thoughts then were that our Lord would not have permitted such a horrible experience unless there was a purpose.

"I had to sign the divorce consent order. I did this with a very heavy heart, but believing I had to be obedient and sacrifice everything on the altar, just as Abraham had been called to do. When my husband initiated divorce, our Lord gave me the story of Abraham and Isaac, and I know that I am being called to sacrifice everything that is precious to me.

"A few days ago I received a letter from my solicitor. The district judge has agreed to the draft consent order subject to certain criteria, being that the judge believes that it is not a fair agreement and is questioning it! I was shocked, and now am praising God for His miracle. I never expected this. God does seem to like to work at the eleventh hour!

"In the last possible moments, He has found a godly and righteous man (or woman) to judge our case. I never expected that anyone would query the consent order and now the whole divorce could be delayed while the agreement is re assessed.

"Our Lord has been delaying the process (lost letters, etc.) ever since it was started. I am being called to sacrifice on the altar, while holding Our Lord's promise to restore this marriage and family in the other hand."

_"The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children."_ _Romans 8:16_

"This past Monday was our court date. I am contesting the divorce that my husband has filed. I have felt impressed by the Lord that our marriage will not end in divorce. In the week leading up to the court date, I was emotional and worried. I kept praying and believing, and by the weekend I was placing my trust and hope in the Lord. I felt an overwhelming sense of peace as our court date approached. Praise the Lord, the hearing was postponed because my husband could not find a witness to prove his case. He told the judge, '(My wife) is still involved with my family and our mutual friends, so I've had a hard time getting someone to agree to be a witness.'

"I believe the postponement is God's way of confirming my hope. My sister was with me, and I believe the words she spoke to my husband are reverberating in his mind. I am standing firm and praying that the blinders continue to come off of his eyes and that he once again sees the truth of God's unconditional love for him." **(Maryland)**

I explained that I needed a copy of the divorce decree since I have never received anything showing I was divorced. She told me she could not find anything in her records. (I am laughing and thinking God if you can do this, wow!)

"She told me there was something in another office. I told her I would check with them. I attempted to contact the attorney on several occasions. He never returned my call. I went to the attorney's office and asked the secretary if they had a copy of the divorce decree. She said the only thing that is in his file was property settlement. She said she could get me a copy of the divorce decree from the courthouse. I started laughing and shared with her about standing for my marriage. She was to get back with me after she called the courthouse, but I have not heard from her yet it, and it has been two weeks.

One got snowed out and at the next one the judge wouldn't sign the final decree because my husband and I were too busy crying and hugging and kissing outside the courthouse. I then went to file my motion for dismissal and was told by the clerk that it wouldn't do any good because too much had happened and my husband would need to agree to it. He said he wanted the divorce and to 'get on with his life.' I filed it anyway.

"When my husband came by for something else, I told him that our final divorce date was approaching. He acted like he didn't know what this date was. I explained the stand for my marriage, and told him I loved him with all my heart. Two days later I received the dismissal for the entire case signed by the judge in the mail.

A WORD JUST FOR YOU

We asked your fellow standers a question: _If your best friend was about to go into divorce court, what brief advice would you give?_

Here are their replies from around the world. May the Holy Spirit take the message you most need to hear, and make His application in your situation today:

"Remember to ask Jesus to stand between you and your spouse, and to say only things you would say to Jesus and to listen to everything through the heart of Jesus. When I have felt discouraged, thinking all this was unfair, I often hear Jesus from the cross saying, 'And me, what have I done to deserve this?' Bear your cross with humility, patience, and confidence in the Lord." **(Canada)**

"When you go through deep waters and walk through fiery trials, God is with you, holding you with His righteous right hand. He will never leave you or forsake you. His plans and purposes will be fulfilled because He does not lie nor change His mind and all His promises to you are Yes and Amen! God has already won the victory for you. This battle does not belong to you but the Lord. Stand firm and see the deliverance that the Lord will bring!" **(Canada)**

"Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails." **(Ohio)**

"In the environment of the courtroom, with man-made laws laying wait to render a decree of dissolution of your marriage, keep foremost in your mind, precious one, that the Lord God Himself was witness to the covenant made at your marriage. You might feel frightened and all alone, but you won't be. Just be strong and of good courage. Do not fear nor be afraid, for the Lord Your God, He is the one who goes with you. Regardless of the outcome, know for certain that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose." **(Pennsylvania)**

"Right now, more than ever, love your mate with Godly love. Lay down your pain at the foot of the Cross. Know that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Rest in the Lord, the victory is already His." **(Florida)**

" _Ezekiel 22:30_ reads, _'And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.'_ Regardless of your circumstances, the most important job you have is to stand in the gap between your mate and an eternity in Hell. If you will be faithful to your covenant marriage, God will remain faithful too. Never give up!" **(West Virginia)**

"The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor. The one who kneels to the Lord can stand up to anything. No weapon formed against you will prosper." **(Tennessee)**

_"You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out and face them and the Lord will be with you." 2_ _Chronicles 20:17_ **(Georgia)**

"God is your lawyer. No matter what happens today, He is defending you and in the end He never loses a case." **(Kansas)**

"Spend your waiting time praising and thanking God that this is the spouse God chose for you. Make a statement of your faith as part of the proceedings if you have the opportunity." **(Illinois)**

"Fear not, my precious friend, for the Lord is with you. If you ask God to heal your marriage, which is the will of God, He will hear you. He has promised in **1 John 5:14 15** to hear us and to give us the petitions that we ask of Him if we ask anything according to His will." **(Michigan)**

_"For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope."_ _Jeremiah 29:11_ (The Living Bible) **(England)**

_"The Word of God is something alive and active: it cuts like any double edged sword but more finely: it can slip through the place where the soul is divided from the spirit, or joints from the marrow; it can judge the secret emotions or thoughts. No created thing can hide from Him; everything is uncovered and open to the eyes of the One to whom we must give account of ourselves."_ _Hebrews 4:12 13_ _,_ (Jerusalem Bible)

_"For I hate divorce,' says the Lord.'"_ _Malachi 2:16_ **.** "Before anyone (prodigal or stander, Christian or not) steps foot into that courtroom, a gut feeling comes over them. That instinct is God sending His message, 'Are you sure? You have to live with this decision! Is this worth it?'

"I can testify that this is the one time I should have listened and heeded to God through His blessed warning that laid in the pit of my stomach. I know now that it was His love for me and my family that lay so deep in my heart that it caused my stomach to churn and be sick. My lesson learned; I make it a point to think and pray every time God gives me this signal, in making any and all decisions." **(New York)**

"The first thing we would do is pray together, and then praise our Father and thank Him for being in total control of her situation. I would make a recommitment to her as her prayer partner, that I will stand with her, and that we will fight this battle together on our knees (the only way it can be fought). I would also remind her that God is faithful. The scripture I would give is _Mark 11:22_ , _"'Have faith in God,' Jesus answered."_ **(Tennessee)**

"Even though things may look bad right now, it doesn't mean that God is not working. He moves in ways that we don't always see, but He still gets the job done! God is still God over every situation in our lives. _'I have a plan for you says the Lord. A plan for good and not evil, to give you a future and a hope.'_ Hang on to that hope." **(Virginia)**

"Therefore since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of highest privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God's glory."

"We can rejoice too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they are good for us, they help us learn to endure. And endurance develops strength of character in us, and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation. And this expectation will not disappoint us. For we know how dearly God loves us, because He has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with love." **(Nevada)**

Don't stop loving your spouse no matter what happens. Just keep looking to Jesus because He has a plan for you and your spouse." **(South Carolina)**

Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.

"If a friend, whether prodigal or stander, were going to divorce court tomorrow, I would remind them of the character of God. God is sovereign first and foremost. God is the Creator and He is greater than His creation; God is Love. Love is enduring, patient, everlasting, and pure, clean, holy, light. God is an almighty, all knowing, all powerful being who emanates pure faithfulness, mercy, grace and forgiveness. What always makes me feel good is knowing that God sees panoramically and simultaneously everything that was, is, and will be. God is an awesome mighty God. He believes in you. Don't be afraid, He is always with you." **(Oregon)**

"I would ask my hurting friend, 'If God Himself were standing in front of you right now, and He asked you what it is that you would have Him do for you, how would you answer?'

"If my friend would say that he or she wanted to see their marriage restored, I would respond, 'Well then, we know how to pray then, don't we?'

"The above is an actual real life experience I had when a friend posed the above question to me when it looked like I was headed for a divorce.

EPILOGUE

It is Tuesday morning, well before 6:00 A.M. Last night at Rejoice Pompano Beach, another of our precious standers shared about her court date that is fast approaching. Charlyne promised her a copy of this yet unfinished manuscript today.

Before printing out the pages, I went through and made several corrections. At this stage of preparing a book, errors are countless. As pages scrolled across the screen, I was thinking what I should say in a note to attach to the manuscript this morning. Just then one sentence from this book seemed to jump out at me:

GOD IS STILL IN CONTROL!

"That's the secret!," I thought. God is still in control. Everything that is happening to you and me today has been filtered through His mighty hands, and there is a reason why the Lord is allowing our lives to unfold as they are. There is no counsel I can give other than to remind you that God is still in control.

How much faith do you need to save a marriage? Only enough to believe that God is still in control. When you walk out of that courtroom, regardless of the outcome, God is still in control. Please do not throw away your faith because of what man has put down on paper.

Between now and the day this book is printed, scores of people will take red pens to it, correcting mistakes. Try as we all may, if you look closely enough, minor mistakes may be found in the published book. May you never allow mistakes to take away from the message, neither in the chapters, nor in the courts.

Mistakes are a part of life, both in writing and in living. May you never allow your mistakes of the past to beat you up in the present. You need not allow others to beat you up over past mistakes, with the Lord as your Protector.

We would be foolish to refuse to have a manuscript edited because we did not like correction. You may need to allow our Lord God to "edit" your life daily. That is the way that mistakes are corrected.

Remember, you are still God's work in progress until the day you die. He has a plan and a purpose that no one can imagine.

Divorce? Yes, No? We do not know, but we are confident that God is still in control. Turn to Him in faith today. He is waiting for your cry.

God is still in control,

Bob and Charlyne

_"So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised."_ _Hebrews 10:35 36_

CHARLYNE'S FAVORITE COURT SCRIPTURES

Did you know that the Bible was the first law book in the world? Every law that exists today was derived from the Ten Commandments. It is sad that the sin of the world has caused so much law to become twisted.

When you are preparing to go to court, remember the Holy Spirit will be going with you. Your Heavenly Father will be watching over the proceedings. Not only did He write the original law, His only Son, Jesus was tried and convicted by the courts of this sinful world.

God understands your hurts and your fears. He knows about your rejection. What better place to receive your encouragement than directly from His Word, the Bible:

_Genesis 50:19-21 -_ _"...'don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God? You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.' And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them."_

_2 Samuel 22:2-4 -_ _"He said: 'The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior—from violent men you save me. I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.'"_

_1 Kings 8:28,31-32 -_ _"Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day...When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple, then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the innocent not guilty, and so establish his innocence."_

_2 Chronicles 7:14-15 -_ _If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land. Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place._

_Job 13:18 -_ _"Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated."_

_Psalm 3:8 -_ _"From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. Selah"_

_Psalm 5:10 12 -_ _"Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you. But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. For surely, O LORD, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield."_

_Psalm 7:1, 8 17 -_ _"O LORD my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me... Let the Lord judge the peoples. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High. O righteous God, who searches minds and hearts, bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure. My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart. God is a righteous judge, a God who expresses his wrath every day. If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow. He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows. He who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment. He who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made. The trouble he causes recoils on himself; his violence comes down on his own head. I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High."_

_Psalm 9:4,8 10 -_ _"For you have upheld my right and my cause; you have sat on your throne, judging righteously... He will judge the world in righteousness; he will govern the peoples with justice. The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD have never forsaken those who seek you."_

_Psalm 18:2 -_ _"The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold."_

_Psalm 18:25-30 -_ _"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless, to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd. You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light. With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall. As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him."_

_Psalm 20:5 -_ _"We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests."_

_Psalm 21:1 5 -_ _"O LORD, the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give! You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head. He asked you for life, and you gave it to him-length of days, for ever and ever. Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty."_

_Psalm 22:8 -_ _"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him."_

_Psalm 24:5 -_ _"He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from God his Savior."_

_Psalm 27:11 14 -_ _"Teach me your way, O LORD; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors. Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD."_

_Psalm 28:6 9 -_ _"Praise be to the LORD, for he has heard my cry for mercy. The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song. The LORD is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever."_

_Psalm 31:14-19 -_ _"But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, 'You are my God.' My times are in your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me. Let your face shine on your servant; save me in your unfailing love. Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I have cried out to you; but let the wicked be put to shame and lie silent in the grave. Let their lying lips be silenced, for with pride and contempt they speak arrogantly against the righteous. How great is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you, which you bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in you."_

_Psalm 32:7 -_ _"You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah"_

_Psalm 34:4 -_ _"I sought the LORD, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears."_

_Psalm 37:9 17 -_ _"For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land. A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright. But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked; for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous."_

_Psalm 37:40 -_ _"The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him."_

_Psalm 40:17 -_ _"Yet I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay."_

_Psalm 43:1-3,5 -_ _"Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from deceitful and wicked men. You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? Send forth your light and your truth, let them guide me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell... Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God."_

_Psalm 45:4 -_ _"In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds."_

_Psalm 59:1-4 -_ _"Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me. Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men. See how they lie in wait for me!

May those who say to me, 'Aha! Aha!' turn back because of their shame. But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, 'Let God be exalted!' Yet I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay."_

_Psalm 71:1 6 -_ _"In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame. Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me. Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men. For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth. From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you."_

_Psalm 72:12 -_ _"For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help."_

_Psalm 79:9 -_ _"Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake."_

Has not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.

Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord. On the contrary: 'If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.'

TAKE A STAND

The thief came a knocking at my front door,  
So I told my spouse there would be no more.  
"You have the 'escape clause," many told me,  
I expected after a divorce to be happy and free.

Something's wrong I thought, alone each night,  
But why do I hurt when divorce seemed so right?  
There is something amiss here when I hurt so,  
My spouse sinned, but my tears they do flow.

Over and over the Lord God attempted to talk to me,  
All I could do was worry about my mate being free.  
Lord, I tried and failed doing it the world's way,  
What, dear God, to me can you promise, do and say?

"Dear child, you can choose to believe My way today,  
Divorce is not the answer, no matter what others say.  
All the prodigal spouses around no problem for Me,  
For them, My son, Jesus, bled and died upon the tree."

"Today take a stand for your marriage to be made new,  
With this being alone and hurting you can be through.  
The path is not easy; I will lead all along the way,  
After I, your God speaks to you, what can anyone say?"

So now I am a stander, with Jesus as my best Friend,  
Yes, Lord, yes, I choose to believe You to the end.  
I believe that my spouse is on the way home tonight,  
Enemy Satan, evil one, you just lost another fight!

MEET THE STEINKAMPS

Bob and Charlyne's marriage was not always blissful. They separated several times and finally divorced in 1986 after 20 years of marriage and with three children.

Charlyne searched the Scriptures and discovered that God hates divorce. She found that our Lord Jesus Christ restores and rebuilds marriages when a mate will love the prodigal unconditionally, as Christ loves us. Charlyne committed herself to a sacrificial stand for the restoration of their marriage. To the glory of God, Bob and Charlyne were remarried on July 7, 1987.

God allowed Bob and Charlyne to minister His love, forgiveness and restoration to others with broken marriages for over twenty years. In December 2010, Bob lost his battle with cancer and end-stage heart disease. Today, Charlyne and her family continue to proclaim the message that God Heals Hurting Families.

You may be reading this book searching for someone to help your marriage problems. His name is Jesus. Please contact us if Rejoice Marriage Ministries can help you discover the difference that the Lord can make in your hurting or dead marriage.

But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him. Jeremiah 17:7

THE GREATEST NEWS

_That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved._ _Romans 10:9_

Have you received Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life? He will save you and be your Comforter and Counselor in the days ahead, regardless of the circumstances. Many people in a hurting marriage have discovered that the first step in a healed marriage is to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Our God and Creator is waiting to hear your prayer.

A Prayer For You

"Dear Jesus, I believe that You died for me and that You rose again on the third day. I confess to You that I am a sinner and that I need Your love and forgiveness. Come into my life, forgive me of my sins, and give me eternal life. I confess to You now that You are my Lord and Savior. Thank You for my salvation. Lord, show me Your will and Your way for my marriage. Mold me and make me to be the spouse I need to be for my mate. Thank You for rebuilding my marriage. Amen."

" _...Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved -- you and your household."_ _Acts 16:31_

TEN SOURCES OF HELP

Here are ten ways that Rejoice Marriage Ministries, Inc. can help you stay encouraged as you stand strong with God and pray for the restoration of your family.

**Prayer –** The number one source of help for your marriage is centered on prayer. While we have several prayer lists and an online Chapel, our goal is to teach you how to pray for your prodigal, for yourself, and for your loved ones.

**The Bible –** We strive to teach you how to get your answers from the Word of God. "Someone said," really should not carry much weight with what you do. Instead, read God's Word daily, seeking His will for your life and marriage. God does speak to His children.

**Web Site –** The Rejoice Marriage Ministries Web site has over a thousand pages of helps, including Q & A, praise reports from standers, testimonies from restored marriages, audio teleconference recordings and much more to help you be able to stand for healing of your marriage. http://RejoiceMinistries.org

**Charlyne Cares –** Seven days a week we send subscribers a daily devotional by that name. Always based on Scripture, Charlyne teaches on topics that will help you grow in the Lord as you pray for your marriage. We also offer a men's and kid's devotional that is sent weekly. Subscribe for free from <http://charlyne.org/>

**Stop Divorce Radio –** We broadcast good music and Good News around the clock for men and women facing marriage problems. You will hear Charlyne and men of God teaching on marriage restoration. You can listen while you work or play. <http://rejoiceministries.org/stop_divorce_radio/>

**God Heals Hurting Marriages –** Our five-minute weekday audio program. We encourage you to get into the habit of listening every day. You will be amazed how often the program's subject will be exactly what you need to hear for that day to be encouraged in the Lord. <http://rejoiceministries.org/stop_divorce_radio/>

**Fight For Your Marriage –** A weekly 30-minute audio Bible study online, during which Charlyne teaches you God's Word on how to grow in the Lord, pray for your family and fight for the healing and restoration of your marriage. <http://rejoiceministries.org/stop_divorce_radio/>

**Stop Divorce Bookstore –** Our online bookstore offers marriage restoration teaching in books and on CDs. We also have other items available, such as front license plates, bracelets and Spanish material. <http://www.stopdivorce.org/>

**Rejoice Pompano –** Standers in South Florida meet with us here in Pompano Beach each month for Bible study, worship, prayer, support and fellowship. From time to time we also take Rejoice on the Road to other communities. <http://rejoiceministries.org/monday.html>

**Personal Contact –** Our goal is for you to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. When He is Savior and Lord of your life, you can allow Him to direct every step in your life and marriage.

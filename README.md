### C++ libraries and packages that support n-gram language models and parallel programming:
 1. KenLM: 
    - https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/ 
    - https://github.com/kpu/kenlm
 2. SRILM: http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/
 3. OpenGrm: http://www.opengrm.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/NGramLibrary
 4. FastText: https://fasttext.cc/ (it is not a direct implementation of N-gram LM, but it represents each word in a text document as a bag of character N-grams, where each N-gram is treated as a separate feature. For example, the word "apple" might be represented as a bag of character trigrams ["app", "ppl", "ple"])
